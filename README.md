# smartlibrary-portal

- Full Screen:
  - Header:
    - Topmost section spanning full width, background color: light blue
    - Title "SMARTLIBRARY" aligned left, bold, uppercase, larger font size
    - Search bar aligned right, placeholder text "Search...", rounded edges
    - Plus sign icon (+) to the right of the search bar
  - Main Content:
    - Two primary columns:
      - Left Column:
        - Background color: white
        - Two sections vertically stacked with header titles "Radiology Reporting" and "Pathology Cancer Reporting"
        - Both sections have a list of items within a bordered box, light blue borders
      - Right Column:
        - Background color: pale blue
        - Multiple boxes representing categories, each with:
          - A header with category name (e.g., "Neuroradiology", "Oncology")
          - A list of specific items (e.g., "CT Traumatic Brain Injury", "CT Pancreatic Cancer")
          - An "> OPEN" button on the bottom right corner of each box
        - Categories are arranged in a grid format with equal width and variable height depending on content
    - Footer:
      - Not visible in the image
- Left Sidebar:
  - Positioned on the far left, full height, with icon buttons vertically aligned, background color: light blue
  - Bottommost icon is three horizontal lines indicating a menu or more options
- Right Sidebar:
  - Not visible in the image

Each box within the main content has consistent styling in terms of border color and button placement. The layout suggests a responsive design, with the potential to collapse the left sidebar into the menu icon on smaller screens.
